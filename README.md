## Plugin Info

OmegaT Character Limiter Plugin lets you limit characters in your
translation projects. Do you want your translation's text length
to be less or equal it's original length? Do you have some global
limit for all segments and don't want to exceed it? Then this plugin
is for you.
It's free, open source and fully configurable, 
so you can adjust it for your needs.

For your convenience there is a new dockable panel implemented
in main OmegaT window. It shows you info about most important
data processed by the plugin, it is source text length, translation length,
global character limit and a percentage showing how much of the characters
are used in the translation and how much space do you still have left:

There are few colors available for percentage value:<br>
ðŸŸ¢<span style="color:green">Green Color</span> (0-60%) lets you know that 
you still have a lot of space left for your translation.<br>
ðŸŸ <span style="color:orange">Orange Color</span> (60-100%) lets you know
that you're getting closer to fill the limit for your translation.<br>
ðŸ”´<span style="color:red">Red Color</span> (100%+) lets you know that
you've already reached your limit, so you should stop translating
and try to rephrase your text.

For your disposition there is also config menu that allows you to
set various options. You can access this config window from the
"Tools" menu in OmegaT and then by clicking "View CharacterLimiter Config":
